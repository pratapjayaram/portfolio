            <h1>Bite Back</h1>
            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <h2>Bite Back is an online resource to support Chicago residents with bed bugs in their homes.</h2>
            <p> Bite back was created as part of Design for America's Summer Studio in 2014. My teammates and I worked with Heartland Alliance, a global non-profit that operates multiple affording housing facilities in the Chicago area, to design a solution to the organization's bed bug problem. Our final concept was a web resource and online community for Heartland residents, and all Chicago residents, which gives visitors the basic information and confidence they need to address bed bugs in their home.</p>

            <h3>Observation</h3>
            <p>We began the process by visiting two of Heartland's housing facilities, the Hollywood House and the Neon Streets Dorm. We observed the spaces they inhabited, spoke to the housing managers, and got to talk to some of the residents. They helped us understand the <b>serious fear that both tenants and management had about bed bug infestations</b>. We realized that having both groups work in harmony could help deal with infestations before they get out of control.</p>

            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Synthesis</h3>
            <p>We then synthesized our research into personas: Gloria, Natascha, and Norman. We also put together journey maps to understand how our users currently react to bed bug infestations, and where we could intervene in the process. It became clear to us that having residents alert management as soon as they detect an infestation would incur minimal damages and allow the problem to be dealt with before it could spread. However, <b>we would need to overcome residents' anxiety about telling landlords about an infestation.</b> This primarily revolved around the belief that bed bugs imply an unclean lifestyle, or that residents can get evicted if their apartment becomes infested. Neither of these is the case, and we needed to communicate that to residents and landlords alike.</p>

            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>We identified multiple directions to approach the problem from, and brainstormed for each unique How Can We statement. The breadth and quality of ideas in the Awareness and Education space caught our attention, and our research backed up the need for services in this space. That's how Bite Back was born.</p>

            <h3>Early Prototyping</h3>
            <p>The image below shows the earliest version Bite Back homepage. The initial idea was to <b>marry a source of information on bed bugs with a digital diary</b>, in which visitors could share their experiences with bed bugs anonymously. Sharers could add to the community's list of best practices, and readers could begin to feel more comfortable and less stigmatized for having bed bugs in their homes.</p>

            <img src="assets\biteback\Main.png" alt="An update I made to the design of the home page after the conclusion of the project" style="width: 80vw;">
            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>When I revisited the project individually, I realized that the website could also be the basis for a service that could directly help people without the resources to fight bed bug infestations. Since the website was already intended to serve the entire Chicago community, I decided to add a system in which visitors could purchase a bed bug cover for their mattress, and in doing so make a small donation towards buying a similar cover for a Heartland resident.</p>
