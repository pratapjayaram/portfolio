            <h2>FreeFrom's <a href="https://compass.freefrom.org">Compensation Compass</a> offers survivors of domestic violence a pathway towards financial justice. To date, it has matched approximately 5,000 survivors with a compensation mindset and corresponding option.</h2>
            <div class="medium-spacer"></div>
            <p>FreeFrom is a national advocacy and support organization for survivors of domestic violence. As part of a 2019 rebrand, they wanted to expand their services to more directly match survivors with options for financial compensation. This compensation can be critical to handling the costs of physical and mental healthcare. Operating with a team of volunteers from Ragtag, a nonprofit tech consulting group, I led the design of the Compensation Compass. The gravity of the subject matter required a careful, considerate approach to the UX and visual design of the tool, as well as close communication with FreeFrom to avoid any possibly triggering or dangerous interactions. Since its launch in late 2019, the Compensation Compass has started approximately 5,000 survivors of domestic assault on the path towards compensation.</p>

            <p>The most challenging aspect of this design was in managing the density of the information about each compensation profile, and its corresponding compensation option. To do this, I focused my design around a clear typographical hierarchy. I also wanted to make sure that the tool was fully WCAG accessible, which was reflected in my color and type choices.</p>

            <p>Having worked on high sensitivity projects in the past, I knew that I had to lean on the expertise of the FreeFrom team to closely review the interactions of the site. One of the most eye opening details that emerged during our back and forth was the need for an "Exit Site" button, which would immediately navigate the user to a totally non-triggering site (specifically, Weather.com). This was a detail that never would have occurred to me on my own, and it's the sort of detail that makes tools like the Compensation Compass truly considerate towards the needs of survivors.</p>
