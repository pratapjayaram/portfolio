            <p>My work at Label Insight can be split into two major categories. I primarily work with three cross-functional teams, two of them internal and one of them external. I work closely with the product managers and front end engineers from these teams to scope platform usability issues and new feature offerings. I organize and perform usability testing with both internal and external users, and use my findings to refine designs. I then present designs back to the cross-functional team and the design team for final feedback and sign-off, before coordinating the development and release of the interface with a front end engineer. While working on incremental improvements to our products, I've also worked closely with the product managers to speak to potential and existing customers and build solid user archetypes, to continue to hone our product vision.</p>
            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <p>My secondary responsibilities are the development and maintenance of our design system. I am the project leader on our design system, meaning I not only am the primary developer of components for use by the design team, but I also collaborate with the front end engineers to consolidate our Sketch-based components with our React-based front end library. I organize and lead group audits of components within our applications, develop usage documentation and style guidelines based on the conversations, and educate the rest of the design team on the usage of these components.</p>
            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <p>In addition to these roles, I've also contributed to workflow improvements in the handoffs between the Customer Success and Design departments, and the front end engineers and the designers they work with. I'm also the design lead on the implementation of Zendesk (for support articles and user request gathering) and Pendo (for basic front end analytics and in-app walkthroughs). I've helped to define how we want to use these tools to improve our user experience, and developed workflows for how they should be implemented to address various user needs.</p>
