            <h1>Spongee</h1>
            <h2>Spongee is a countertop companion that helps apartment tenants maintain a clean kitchen.</h2>
            <p>Spongee was a project from the Interaction Design class at Northwestern, which I worked on with Sam Kim and Alex Sher. We were all recently moved into own apartments, and all struggling with the prospect of cooking for ourselves. To help bring order to the chaos in our kitchens, and the kitchens of our fellow students, we designed Spongee. Spongee is a kitchen sponge holder that also tracks the number of dishes you wash, and lets you compare your kitchen cleanliness with your friends and neighbors.</p>

            <h3>Observation</h3>
            <p>Since we were allowed to choose any project we wanted, Sam, Alex, and I decided to pick an issue we were grappling with ourselves. We talked to our fellow students who also lived outside of the dorms, and asked them what discouraged them the most about cooking for themselves.</p>

            <h3>Synthesis</h3>
            <p>We heard a variety of responses, but what stuck out to us among all of them was the constant problem of having to clean up after cooking. It was nearly universal in our conversations, and we all immediately related to the struggle. We were also struck by the personal nature of the issue. <b>Many of our interviewees expressed frustration at roommates who used all of the kitchenware and then failed to clean it afterwards, rendering the kitchen useless for the rest of the household</b>. They didn't feel comfortable calling out their roommates, though, because they didn't want to start a conflict.</p>

            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <p>After identifying the core of the problem as accountability around kitchen cleanliness, we started mocking up ideas. The one which resonated the most with users was a dish tracker, which would let users see how many dishes they and their roommates were (or weren't) cleaning. Users liked the playful nature of the design, and appreciated that it served a dual purpose as a sponge holder.</p>

            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <p>Our next mockup was a 3D printed version of Spongee, with an evolved form and enhanced ergonomics. We changed to a spherical form, but kept the sense of playfulness with an embossed bowtie. We also changed the angle of Spongee's mouth for more ergonomic sponge placement, and added drainage holes at the back of his mouth to keep dirty water from building up.</p>

            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <p>As we continued to define the form, we also developed the companion app for Spongee, to let users access their dish cleaning metrics. The core of the app is a simple dish tracker and kitchen health monitor. With this main view, users can quickly tell whether they're pulling their weight. The health score was our way to continue the playful aesthetic for Spongee, by including messages from Spongee to the user that reflect the health score. As the score gets lower, Spongee's messages get more upset, and the user starts receiving more frequent notifications. <b>This was our way of removing the burden of cleaning reminders from the tenants; instead, Spongee plays the bad cop</b>. We also wanted to create a sense of friendly competition among Spongee users, and so we thought of creating a "league" feature, letting users compare their apartment's health score to their neighbors'. Finally, we wanted to include additional resources for keeping a clean kitchen, such as cleaning tips or recipes with low cleanup.</p>
