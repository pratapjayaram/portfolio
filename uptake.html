            <p>Uptake is a software startup based in Chicago that builds predictive analytics tools for large, industrial companies. I'm a User Experience Design intern working on the company's data ingestion platform, which is used both internally and externally to manage the onboarding and quality control of client data.</p>
            <div class="small-spacer"></div>
            <p>While my original role was purely on the design side of the project, I began by participating heavily in the research efforts, conducting interviews and helping to create personas. I was then put in charge of designing one of the main diagnostic and monitoring tools in the product, and I've since been working closely with a development team and design researchers to quickly build and iterate interfaces as part of an Agile process. I also work closely with product owners and managers to make sure that client needs are being addressed appropriately. My process involves building low fidelity prototypes in Axure, and development-ready comps in Sketch, while testing with users and stakeholders between each iteration in scheduled and guerrilla testing sessions. As the product scales to accommodate more users and data types, I'm working to define the improvements in the information architecture and system interactions, as well as how best to visualize the data so that the right message is being communicated to users.
